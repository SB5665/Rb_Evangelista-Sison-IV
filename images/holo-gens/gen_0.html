    <p class="Talents"> 
      Tokino Sora, the first Virtual Idol of Hololive. A very good singer, and loves playing horror games. She has a happy-go-lucky and comforting personality, tying closely to the word "idol" the most out of the VTubers of her industry. 
    </p>

<div id="roboco">

  <img id="Gen0" src="../images/roboco.png" alt="Roboco-san">

  <p class="Talents" >
Roboco-san is a robot who loves to strike cute poses. She is known to have a calm and comforting voice, which may sound like a person whispering. She loves to shoot people due to her killer instinct, but isn't well professed in doing so in video games. Instead, she runs them over with a vehicle. She also hates when video games surprise her.

<div id="azki">

  <img id="Gen0" src="../images/azki.png" alt="AZKi" >
  <p class="Talents" >
    AZKi is an idol who was reincarnated in the virtual world in order to bring her own fabricated world full of people with extraterrestrial talent. Like Sora, she is also very good at singing and comforting people, however she is known for browsing the internet, sometimes searching herself out of random.

<div id="miko">

  <img id="Gen0" src="../images/miko.png" alt="Sakura Miko" >
  <p class="Talents" >
  Sakura Miko is an Ex-Shrine Maiden who, after following the Gods' order, was sent to Japan, where she met Tokino Sora. Out of admiration, she decided to follow her in becoming a VTuber. As a VTuber, she is known for falling out of her role whenever she plays violent games and getting attached to some of the NPCs of those games very easily. She introduced the catchphrase, "Nyahello" as a way to greet her fans.

<div id="suisei">

  <img id="Gen0" src="../images/suisei.png" alt="Hoshimachi Suisei">
  <p class="Talents" >
  Hoshimachi Suisei is an idol who, like AZKi, is very good at singing. She refers to herself as "Forever 18", signifying that she is at her prime at all times. Although she appears to be close to the personality of a normal idol, she does have an alternate persona known as "Psychopath Suisei", where she has the tendency to kill fellow members in game while sounding polite and sweet.
