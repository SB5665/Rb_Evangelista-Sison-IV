        <p class="Talents" >
         Akai Haato, also known by her alter ego Haachama, is sassy and prickly, although she gets flustered quite easily. She is mostly calm, although she is known for shouting a lot when she is playing games. Her alter ego, on the other hand, is a childish and yet evil creep, quite the opposite to her normal self. This alter ego would come out at random, making funny moments out of berating Akai Haato.
