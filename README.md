Title: HoloTips: Into The Rabbit Hole

Homepage Description: This website is a guide to Hololive, an idol VTuber company created to provide a source of entertainment on YouTube. Before an explanation on the website, it would also be better to explain what a VTuber is first. The word VTuber stems from the phrase "Virtual Youtuber", where people use computer softwares to  act as a virtual model which captures their face and traces it to the model.

Webpage Descriptions: The webpages will be split into two parts. The first half will explain 
the VTubers and how to choose a main idol to watch, while the second half will be our personal preference, which may give you a more accurate idea on who to choose.

The first page will explain the general similarities of the VTubers of Hololive, and their sub-groups.

The second page will give the grasp on how to choose the main idol you want to watch.

The third page will be an explanation of my main idol and why I chose that idol, while the fourth will be Shawn's idol and why he chose her.
