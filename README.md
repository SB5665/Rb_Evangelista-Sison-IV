Title: HoloGuide: Into The Rabbit Hole

Homepage Description: This website is a guide to Hololive, an idol VTuber company created to provide a source of entertainment on YouTube. Before an explanation on the website, it would also be better to explain what a VTuber is first. The word VTuber stems from the phrase "Virtual Youtuber", where people use computer softwares to  act as a virtual model which captures their face and traces it to the model.

Webpage Descriptions: The website will be split into two parts. The first half will explain 
the VTubers and introduces you to the talents of Hololive and guide you on which main idol you like most, while the second half will be about the important events that happened in the company and the albums released by the idols, which may give you a more accurate idea on what Hololive really is.

The About Us page will explain what Hololive is and what is the purpose of the site.

The Talent page will give the grasp on the many talents that can be found in Hololive.

The Time line page will be a time line of events starting from the founding of the comapny to recent events.

The Music page will be filled with albums and covers that the idols have created.
